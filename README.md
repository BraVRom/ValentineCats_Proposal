# ValentineCats_Proposal

This is a web project I made in a short time for a Valentine's Day proposal. I don't think it's that spectacular, but my girlfriend loved the gesture, and it made her laugh. Obviously, she said yes. 😄

The project is interactive and fun, featuring cute cat gifs. The user is asked a cute Valentine's question, and if they select "Yes," cute animations, music and messages appear. If they select "No," there are funny interactions that make it harder to say no! 😆

🚀 **Features**

- Cute Cats and design (but not fully responsive)
- Animated cat GIFs jumping around
- Dynamic button interactions
- Funny messages
- Smooth CSS animations and transitions

I created this in a short time, so there might be some responsiveness issues on smaller screens like mobile devices, but it works fine on most other sizes. Feel free to fork it and make improvements!
